ly (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Support Zig 0.13.0 (this is a tad late, but supporting Zig 0.14.0 would mean breaking support for 0.12.0 and 0.13.0 which is not ideal)
  * Try to create /etc/pam.d and /usr/bin everytime when installing
  * Don't set XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP and XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP if they're empty
  * Possibly fix .Xresources not being loaded
